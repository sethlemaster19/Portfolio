	    </br><h1></br>What I Know</h1>
	    <p><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> While working at Urban Air I have learned so 
	    many skills but the biggest one would have to be communication skills.
	    At Urban Air you have to know what is going on at all times while hundreds 
	    of children are jumping and screaming at you and it helps when your co-workers
	    communicate and let you know what is happening.</p>
	    <p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> While at Lewis and Clark I learned many things from
	    my instructor. One of the things he had taught us thoroughly is adaptability.
	    When I first started the class I was shy and didn't really talk to anyone but then
	    I learned that I have to adapt and get things done. By the end of the first semester 
	    I became friends with everyone in the class.
	    </p>
	    <p><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Ever since i was young i've loved to solve
	    problems. If a clock wasnt working i would fix it. strategy games are my favorite 
	    activety in my free time, i will spend hours upon hours finding ways to destroy my 
	    enemies. programming is all about solving new problems everyday and thats why 
	    i enjoy what im going to be doing.</p>
	    <p><strong>Creativity:</strong> Along with solving problems i also like to think of
	    creative ways to solve problems. When designing something i always think of ways
	    to be unique but also keep in mind what im presenting and how others may view
	    what im doing.</p>
