         <h1>How It Started</h1>
         
	 <p id="life"> When I was little all I wanted to do was go outside with my friends and 
	 play soccer which I played competitevly until my junior year of high school.
	 Then I was introduced to my brothers Xbox 360. Ever since then I have had 
	 a strong passion for electronics and videogames. I love to play strategy games 
	 because I love to solve problems and try to get out of sticky situations. My senior 
	 year of high school I attended at Lewis and Clark Career Center. There I took the 
	 computer software developement program and I found my calling and what I 
	 want to be doing for the rest of my life.
