	    <p id="urbanair"><strong>Job Description:</strong> My role at Urban Air was to watch 
	    customers as they jumped and flew through the air and kept them safe.
	    Following the rules is something that is a must and I believe that should
	    go for everything. I've learned and taught leadership at Urban Air. Team 
	    work makes the dream work at this estblishment. I had to know where my 
	    co-workers were at all time in-case of emergency. Overall this job has brought
	    many skills to the table for me.</p>
